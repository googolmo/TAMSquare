 * Result object for venues/search request

 * In version 20110615 Foursquare changes venues/search request to return 
 * array of venues instead of venue groups what request used to result, 
 * with an exception that sometimes request might still return groups. 
 * For example, on election days, foursquare may choose to temporarily 
 * add a pollingplaces group, which your application should handle gracefully.
